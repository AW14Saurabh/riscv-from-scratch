## RISC-V from scratch

The `src` directory in this branch contains the code necessary to follow along with [RISC-V from scratch 3: Writing a UART driver in assembly (1 / 3)](https://twilco.github.io/riscv-from-scratch/2019/07/08/riscv-from-scratch-3.html).  In this post, we begin implementation of a driver for the `virt` onboard UART, discussing the basics of UART functionality and additional linker script and devicetree layout exploration along the way.

You'll also notice a directory in this repository called `work`, which can be used as your personal working directory as you progress through the series, allowing you to move from branch to branch and pull from or compare with `src` as you please.
