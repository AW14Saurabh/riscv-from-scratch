## RISC-V from scratch

The `src` directory in this branch contains the code necessary to follow along with [TODO PUT POST IN HERE](TODO PUT POST IN HERE).  TODO: Update the following text.  In this post, we continue implementation of a driver for the `virt` onboard UART, diagramming instruction-by-instruction the what, why, and how of function prologues. Also discusses other topics such as ABIs, more RISC-V assembly instructions, and function epilogues.

You'll notice a directory in this repository called `work`, which can be used as your personal working directory as you progress through the series, allowing you to move from branch to branch and pull from or compare with `src` as you please.

If you have any questions, comments, or corrections, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/twilco/twilco.github.io/issues) or leave a comment on the posts themselves.
